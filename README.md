# ü¶ñ Dino Project

## üìù Introduction

The Dino Project aims to recreate the famous Chrome Dino Game using Python programming and the Pygame library. The Chrome Dino Game is a simple and addictive offline game that appears in the Google Chrome browser when there is no internet connection. The project includes two versions: `dino_fly.py`, which features a flying dinosaur, and `dino_run.py`, a standard version similar to the classic Chrome dinosaur game.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dinosaur Movement:** Control the dinosaur's movements, including running, jumping, and flying (in `dino_fly.py`).
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Navigate the dinosaur to avoid obstacles and score points.
- **Graphics:** Simple yet visually appealing graphics for the dinosaur character and obstacles.
- **Animations:** Smooth animations for the dinosaur's actions, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- **Code Structure:** Well-organized codebase divided into modular functions and classes for easy maintenance.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pygame

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed.
3. Run `python dino_fly.py` or `python dino_run.py` to play the respective version of the game.

## Challenges and Takeaways

1. **Graphics Creation:**
   - *Challenge:* Learning 2D graphic design to create suitable graphics for the game.
   - *Takeaway:* Improved skills in designing visually appealing graphics.

2. **Animation Logic:**
   - *Challenge:* Implementing smooth and responsive animations for the dinosaur's actions.
   - *Takeaway:* Learned how to handle animation frames and timings effectively.

3. **Collision Detection:**
   - *Challenge:* Pending implementation of accurate collision detection using hitboxes and collision algorithms.
   - *Takeaway:* Recognized the importance of precise collision detection for gameplay mechanics.

4. **Code Structure:**
   - *Challenge:* Organizing the growing complexity of the codebase into manageable modules and functions.
   - *Takeaway:* Improved skills in organizing code into smaller, modular functions and classes.
