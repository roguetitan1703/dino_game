INTRODUCTION
This project aims to imitate the famous Chrome Dino Game using Python programming and the Pygame library. The Chrome Dino Game is a simple and addictive offline game that appears in the Google Chrome browser when there is no internet connection. 
The first version, `dino_fly.py`, has an extra feature allowing the dinosaur to fly, while the second version, `dino_run.py`, is a standard game like the classic Chrome dinosaur game.

CHALLENGES
Graphics Creation
One of the initial challenges I faced while working on my Dino Project was designing and creating graphics. As a beginner in 2D graphic design, I had to learn how to create simple yet visually appealing graphics for the dinosaur character and the obstacles. However, with practice and experimentation, I was able to come up with suitable graphics that served the purpose of the game.
I am pleased with how the graphics turned out. They are simple but effective, and they help to create a fun and engaging game.
Animation Logic
The next challenge was implementing smooth animations for the dinosaur's actions, such as running, jumping, and flying. I had to carefully handle animation frames and timings to ensure that the animations looked natural and responsive.
I found that using counters and lists to control the animations was the most effective way to achieve the desired results. I am pleased with how the animations turned out, and they add a lot of life to the game.
Collision Detection
One of the challenges I recognized but haven't fully implemented in the provided code is collision detection. Proper collision detection logic is crucial for determining when the dinosaur collides with obstacles, leading to game over scenarios or other responses. I plan to use hitboxes and collision algorithms to make the collision detection more accurate.

Code Structure
As the project evolved, the complexity of the codebase increased, and organizing the code properly became essential. I found that dividing the code into smaller, modular functions and classes made it more manageable and easier to understand.
I am satisfied with how the code is structured. It is well-organized and easy to read, which makes it easy to maintain and update the code in the future

Takeaway
While working on the Dino Project, I learned a lot about game development and Python programming. I learned how to use the Pygame library to create 2D games, how to implement basic game concepts like game loops, event handling, sprite rendering, and collision detection. I also learned how to create and load graphics for the game's characters, backgrounds, and obstacles.

I also learned how to implement animations for characters such as running, jumping, and flying. I learned how to handle keyboard inputs to control the dinosaur's actions. Finally, I learned about game physics and how to handle the dinosaur's movements, jumping, and falling.

Skills and Concepts Learned
The following are the skills and concepts that I learned from the Dino Project:

1.	How to use the Pygame library to create 2D games in Python.
2.	Basic game concepts like game loops, event handling, sprite rendering, and collision detection.
3.	How to create and load graphics for the game's characters, backgrounds, and obstacles.
4.	How to implement animations for characters such as running, jumping, and flying.
5.	How to handle keyboard inputs to control the dinosaur's actions.
6.	How to handle game physics and how to handle the dinosaur's movements, jumping, and falling.

Conclusion
I am very pleased with the results of the Dino Project. Despite the challenges encountered along the way, I have learned a lot and grown as a programmer. I am excited to continue refining the project and addressing the challenges to create an enjoyable and polished game.
